       "'So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed , it will not go through both slits . If it\\'s unobserved it will , however , if it\\'s observed after it\\'s left the plane  but  before  it  hits  its  target  ,  it  will  not  have  gone  through  both  slits  .  Agreed  ,  what\\'s  your  point  ?  There\\'s  no  point  ,  I  just  think  it\\'s  a  good  idea  for  a  tee-shirt  .  Excuse  me  ?  Hang  on  .  One  across  is  Aegean  ,  eight  down  is  Nabakov  ,  twenty-six  across  is  MCM  ,  fourteen  down  is  ...  move  your  finger  ...  phylum  ,  which  makes  fourteen  across  Port-au-Prince  .  See  ,  Papa  Doc\\'s  capital  idea  ,  that\\'s  Port-au-Prince  .  Haiti  .  Can  I  help  you  ?  Yes  .  Um  ,  is  this  the  High  IQ  sperm  bank  ?  If  you  have  to  ask  ,  maybe  you  shouldn\\'t  be  here  .  I  think  this  is  the  place  .  Fill  these  out  .  Thank-you  .  We\\'ll  be  right  back  .  Oh  ,  take  your  time  .  I\\'ll  just  finish  my  crossword  puzzle  .  Oh  ,  wait  .  Leonard  ,  I  don\\'t  think  I  can  do  this  .  What  ,  are  you  kidding  ?  You\\'re  a  semi-pro  .  No  .  We  are  committing  genetic  fraud  .  There\\'s  no  guarantee  that  our  sperm  is  going  to  generate  high  IQ  offspring  ,  think  about  that  .  I  have  a  sister  with  the  same  basic  DNA  mix  who  hostesses  at  Fuddruckers  .  Sheldon  ,  this  was  your  idea  .  A  little  extra  money  to  get  fractional  T1  bandwidth  in  the  apartment  .  I  know  ,  and  I  do  yearn  for  faster  downloads  ,  but  there\\'s  some  poor  woman  is  going  to  pin  her  hopes  on  my  sperm  ,  what  if  she  winds  up  with  a  toddler  who  doesn\\'t  know  if  he  should  use  an  integral  or  a  differential  to  solve  the  area  under  a  curve  .  I\\'m  sure  she\\'ll  still  love  him  .  I  wouldn\\'t  .  Well  ,  what  do  you  want  to  do  ?  I  want  to  leave  .  Okay  .  What\\'s  the  protocol  for  leaving  ?  I  don\\'t  know  ,  I\\'ve  never  reneged  on  a  proffer  of  sperm  before  .  Let\\'s  try  just  walking  out  .  Okay  .  Bye  .  Bye-bye  See  you  .  Are  you  still  mad  about  the  sperm  bank  ?  No  .  You  want  to  hear  an  interesting  thing  about  stairs  ?  Not  really  .  If  the  height  of  a  single  step  is  off  by  as  little  as  two  millimetres  ,  most  people  will  trip  .  I  don\\'t  care  .  Two  millimetres  ?  That  doesn\\'t  seem  right  .  No  ,  it\\'s  true  ,  I  did  a  series  of  experiments  when  I  was  twelve  ,  my  father  broke  his  clavicle  .  Is  that  why  they  sent  you  to  boarding  school  ?  No  ,  that  was  the  result  of  my  work  with  lasers  .  New  neighbor  ?  Evidently  .  Significant  improvement  over  the  old  neighbor  .  Two  hundred  pound  transvestite  with  a  skin  condition  ,  yes  she  is  .  Oh  ,  hi  !  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  ?  We  don\\'t  mean  to  interrupt  ,  we  live  across  the  hall  .  Oh  ,  that\\'s  nice  .  Oh  ...  uh  ...  no  ...  we  don\\'t  live  together  ...  um  ...  we  live  together  but  in  separate  ,  heterosexual  bedrooms  .  Oh  ,  okay  ,  well  ,  guess  I\\'m  your  new  neighbor  ,  Penny  .  Leonard  ,  Sheldon  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Well  ,  uh  ,  oh  ,  welcome  to  the  building  .  Thank  you  ,  maybe  we  can  have  coffee  sometime  .  Oh  ,  great  .  Great  .  Great  .  Great  .  Well  ,  bye  .  Bye  .  Bye  .  Bye  .  Should  we  have  invited  her  for  lunch  ?  No  .  We\\'re  going  to  start  Season  Two  of  \"  Battlestar  Galactica  \"  .  We  already  watched  the  Season  Two  DVDs  .  Not  with  commentary  .  I  think  we  should  be  good  neighbors  ,  invite  her  over  ,  make  her  feel  welcome  .  We  never  invited  Louis-slash-Louise  over  .  Well  ,  then  that  was  wrong  of  us  .  We  need  to  widen  our  circle  .  I  have  a  very  wide  circle  .  I  have  212  friends  on  myspace  .  Yes  ,  and  you\\'ve  never  met  one  of  them  .  That\\'s  the  beauty  of  it  .  I\\'m  going  to  invite  her  over  .  We\\'ll  have  a  nice  meal  and  chat  .  Chat  ?  We  don\\'t  chat  .  At  least  not  offline  .  Well  it\\'s  not  difficult  ,  you  just  listen  to  what  she  says  ,  and  then  you  say  something  appropriate  in  response  .  To  what  end  ?  Hi  .  Again  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Anyway  ,  um  .  We  brought  home  Indian  food  .  And  ,  um  .  I  know  that  moving  can  be  stressful  ,  and  I  find  that  when  I\\'m  undergoing  stress  ,  that  good  food  and  company  can  have  a  comforting  effect  .  Also  ,  curry  is  a  natural  laxative  ,  and  I  don\\'t  have  to  tell  you  that  ,  uh  ,  a  clean  colon  is  just  one  less  thing  to  worry  about  .  Leonard  ,  I\\'m  not  expert  here  but  I  believe  in  the  context  of  a  luncheon  invitation  ,  you  might  want  to  skip  the  reference  to  bowel  movements  .  Oh  ,  you\\'re  inviting  me  over  to  eat  ?  Uh  ,  yes  .  Oh  ,  that\\'s  so  nice  ,  I\\'d  love  to  .  Great  .  So  ,  what  do  you  guys  do  for  fun  around  here  ?  Well  ,  today  we  tried  masturbating  for  money  .  Okay  ,  well  ,  make  yourself  at  home  .  Okay  ,  thankyou  .  You\\'re  very  welcome  .  This  looks  like  some  serious  stuff  ,  Leonard  ,  did  you  do  this  ?  Actually  that\\'s  my  work  .  Wow  .  Yeah  ,  well  ,  it\\'s  just  some  quantum  mechanics  ,  with  a  little  string  theory  doodling  around  the  edges  .  That  part  there  ,  that\\'s  just  a  joke  ,  it\\'s  a  spoof  of  the  Bourne-Oppenheimer  approximation  .  So  you\\'re  like  ,  one  of  those  ,  beautiful  mind  genius  guys  .  Yeah  .  This  is  really  impressive  .  I  have  a  board  .  If  you  like  boards  ,  this  is  my  board  .  Holy  smokes  .  If  by  holy  smokes  you  mean  a  derivative  restatement  of  the  kind  of  stuff  you  can  find  scribbled  on  the  wall  of  any  men\\'s  room  at  MIT  ,  sure  .  What  ?  Oh  ,  come  on  .  Who  hasn\\'t  seen  this  differential  below  \"  here  I  sit  broken  hearted?  \"  At  least  I  didn\\'t  have  to  invent  twenty-six  dimensions  just  to  make  the  math  come  out  .  I  didn\\'t  invent  them  ,  they\\'re  there  .  In  what  universe  ?  In  all  of  them  ,  that  is  the  point  .  Uh  ,  do  you  guys  mind  if  I  start  ?  Um  ,  Penny  ...  that\\'s  where  I  sit  .  So  ,  sit  next  to  me  .  ...  No  ,  I  sit  there  .  What\\'s  the  difference  ?  \"  What\\'s  the  difference  \"  ?  Here  we  go  .  In  the  winter  that  seat  is  close  enough  to  the  radiator  to  remain  warm  ,  and  yet  not  so  close  as  to  cause  perspiration  .  In  the  summer  it\\'s  directly  in  the  path  of  a  cross  breeze  created  by  open  windows  there  ,  and  there  .  It  faces  the  television  at  an  angle  that  is  neither  direct  ,  thus  discouraging  conversation  ,  nor  so  far  wide  to  create  a  parallax  distortion  .  I  could  go  on  ,  but  I  think  I\\'ve  made  my  point  .  Do  you  want  me  to  move  ?  Well-  Just  sit  somewhere  else  .  Fine  .  Sheldon  ,  sit  !  Aaah  !  Well  ,  this  is  nice  .  We  don\\'t  have  a  lot  of  company  over  .  That\\'s  not  true  .  Koothrapali  and  Wolowitz  come  over  all  the  time  .  Yes  ,  I  know  ,  but  ...  Tuesday  night  we  played  Klingon  boggle  until  one  in  the  morning  .  Yes  ,  I  remember  .  I  resent  you  saying  we  don\\'t  have  company  .  I\\'m  sorry  .  That  is  an  antisocial  implication  .  I  said  I\\'m  sorry  .  So  ,  Klingon  boggle  ?  Yeah  ,  it\\'s  like  regular  boggle  ,  but  in  Klingon  .  That\\'s  probably  enough  about  us  ,  tell  us  about  you  .  Um  ,  me  ,  okay  ,  I\\'m  Sagittarius  ,  which  probably  tells  you  way  more  than  you  need  to  know  .  Yes  ,  it  tells  us  that  you  participate  in  the  mass  cultural  delusion  that  the  Sun\\'s  apparent  position  relative  to  arbitrarily  defined  constellations  and  the  time  of  your  birth  somehow  effects  your  personality  .  Participate  in  the  what  ?  I  think  what  Sheldon\\'s  trying  to  say  ,  is  that  Sagittarius  wouldn\\'t  have  been  our  first  guess  .  Oh  ,  yeah  ,  a  lot  of  people  think  I\\'m  a  water  sign  .  Okay  ,  let\\'s  see  ,  what  else  ,  oh  ,  I\\'m  a  vegetarian  ,  oh  ,  except  for  fish  ,  and  the  occasional  steak  ,  I  love  steak  .  That\\'s  interesting  .  Leonard  can\\'t  process  corn  .  Wu-uh  ,  do  you  have  some  sort  of  a  job  ?  Oh  ,  yeah  ,  I\\'m  a  waitress  at  the  Cheesecake  Factory  .  Oh  ,  okay  .  I  love  cheesecake  .  You\\'re  lactose  intolerant  .  I  don\\'t  eat  it  ,  I  just  think  it\\'s  a  good  idea  .  Oh  ,  anyways  ,  I\\'m  also  writing  a  screenplay  .  It\\'s  about  this  sensitive  girl  who  comes  to  L.A  .  from  Lincoln  Nebraska  to  be  an  actress  ,  and  winds  up  a  waitress  at  the  Cheesecake  Factory  .  So  it\\'s  based  on  your  life  ?  No  ,  I\\'m  from  Omaha  .  Well  ,  if  that  was  a  movie  I  would  go  see  it  .  I  know  ,  right  ?  Okay  ,  let\\'s  see  ,  what  else  ?  Um  ,  that\\'s  about  it  .  That\\'s  the  story  of  Penny  .  Well  it  sounds  wonderful  .  It  was  .  Until  I  fell  in  love  with  a  jerk  .  What\\'s  happening  .  I  don\\'t  know  .  Oh  God  ,  you  know  ,  four  years  I  lived  with  him  ,  four  years  ,  that\\'s  like  as  long  as  High  School  .  It  took  you  four  years  to  get  through  High  School  ?  Don\\'t  .  I  just  ,  I  can\\'t  believe  I  trusted  him  .  Should  I  say  something  ?  I  feel  like  I  should  say  something  .  You  ?  No  ,  you\\'ll  only  make  it  worse  .  You  want  to  know  the  most  pathetic  part  ?  Even  though  I  hate  his  lying  ,  cheating  guts  ,  I  still  love  him  .  Is  that  crazy  ?  Yes  .  No  ,  it\\'s  not  crazy  it\\'s  ,  uh  ,  uh  ,  it\\'s  a  paradox  .  And  paradoxes  are  part  of  nature  ,  think  about  light  .  Now  if  you  look  at  Huygens  ,  light  is  a  wave  ,  as  confirmed  by  the  double  slit  experiments  ,  but  then  ,  along  comes  Albert  Einstein  and  discovers  that  light  behaves  like  particles  too  .  Well  ,  I  didn\\'t  make  it  worse  .  Oh  ,  I\\'m  so  sorry  ,  I\\'m  such  a  mess  ,  and  on  top  of  everything  else  I\\'m  all  gross  from  moving  and  my  stupid  shower  doesn\\'t  even  work  .  Our  shower  works  .  Really  ?  Would  it  be  totally  weird  if  I  used  it  ?  Yes  .  No  .  No  ?  No  .  No  .  It\\'s  right  down  the  hall  .  Thanks  .  You  guys  are  really  sweet  .  Well  this  is  an  interesting  development  .  How  so  ?  It  has  been  some  time  since  we\\'ve  had  a  woman  take  her  clothes  off  in  our  apartment  .  That\\'s  not  true  ,  remember  at  Thanksgiving  my  grandmother  with  Alzheimer\\'s  had  that  episode  .  Point  taken  .  It  has  been  some  time  since  we\\'ve  had  a  woman  take  her  clothes  off  after  which  we  didn\\'t  want  to  rip  our  eyes  out  .  The  worst  part  was  watching  her  carve  that  turkey  .  So  ,  what  exactly  are  you  trying  to  accomplish  here  ?  Excuse  me  ?  That  woman  in  there\\'s  not  going  to  have  sex  with  you  .  Well  I\\'m  not  trying  to  have  sex  with  her  .  Oh  ,  good  .  Then  you  won\\'t  be  disappointed  .  What  makes  you  think  she  wouldn\\'t  have  sex  with  me  ,  I\\'m  a  male  and  she\\'s  a  female  ?  Yes  ,  but  not  of  the  same  species  .  I\\'m  not  going  to  engage  in  hypotheticals  here  ,  I\\'m  just  trying  to  be  a  good  neighbor  .  Oh  ,  of  course  .  That\\'s  not  to  say  that  if  a  carnal  relationship  were  to  develop  that  I  wouldn\\'t  participate  .  However  briefly  .  Do  you  think  this  possibility  will  be  helped  or  hindered  when  she  discovers  your  Luke  Skywalker  no-more-tears  shampoo  ?  It\\'s  Darth  Vader  shampoo  .  Luke  Skywalker\\'s  the  conditioner  .  Wait  till  you  see  this  .  It\\'s  fantastic  .  Unbelievable  .  See  what  ?  It\\'s  a  Stephen  Hawking  lecture  from  MIT  in  1974  .  This  is  not  a  good  time  .  It\\'s  before  he  became  a  creepy  computer  voice  That\\'s  great  ,  you  guys  have  to  go  .  Why  ?  It\\'s  just  not  a  good  time  .  Leonard  has  a  lady  over  .  Yeah  ,  right  ,  your  grandmother  back  in  town  ?  No  .  And  she\\'s  not  a  lady  ,  she\\'s  just  a  new  neighbor  .  Hang  on  ,  there  really  is  a  lady  here  ?  Uh-huh  .  And  you  want  us  out  because  you\\'re  anticipating  coitus  ?  I\\'m  not  anticipating  coitus  .  So  she\\'s  available  for  coitus  ?  Can  we  please  stop  saying  coitus  ?  Technically  that  would  be  coitus  interruptus  .  Hey  ,  is  there  a  trick  to  getting  it  to  switch  from  tub  to  shower  ?  Oh  .  Hi  ,  sorry  .  Hello  !  Enchante  ,  Madamoiselle  .  Howard  Wolowitz  ,  Cal-Tech  department  of  Applied  Physics  .  You  may  be  familiar  with  some  of  my  work  ,  it\\'s  currently  orbiting  Jupiter\\'s  largest  moon  taking  high-resolution  digital  photographs  .  Penny  .  I  work  at  the  Cheesecake  Factory  .  Come  on  ,  I\\'ll  show  you  the  trick  with  the  shower  .  Bon  douche  .  I\\'m  sorry  ?  It\\'s  French  for  good  shower  .  It\\'s  a  sentiment  I  can  express  in  six  languages  .  Save  it  for  your  blog  ,  Howard  .  See-ka-tong-guay-jow  .  Uh  ,  there  it  goes  ,  it  sticks  ,  I\\'m  sorry  .  Okay  .  Thanks  .  You\\'re  welcome  ,  oh  ,  you\\'re  going  to  step  right  ,  okay  ,  I\\'ll  ...  .  Hey  ,  Leonard  ?  The  hair  products  are  Sheldon\\'s  .  Um  ,  okay  .  Can  I  ask  you  a  favour  .  A  favour  ?  Sure  ,  you  can  ask  me  a  favour  ,  I  would  do  you  a  favour  for  you  .  It\\'s  okay  if  you  say  no  .  Oh  ,  I\\'ll  probably  say  yes  .  It\\'s  just  not  the  kind  of  thing  you  ask  a  guy  you\\'ve  just  met  .  Wow  .  I  really  think  we  should  examine  the  chain  of  causality  here  .  Must  we  ?  Event  A.  A  beautiful  woman  stands  naked  in  our  shower  .  Event  B.  We  drive  half  way  across  town  to  retrieve  a  television  set  from  the  aforementioned  woman\\'s  ex-boyfriend  .  Query  ,  on  what  plane  of  existence  is  there  even  a  semi-rational  link  between  these  events  ?  She  asked  me  to  do  her  a  favour  ,  Sheldon  .  Ah  ,  yes  ,  well  that  may  be  the  proximal  cause  of  our  journey  ,  but  we  both  know  it  only  exists  in  contradistinction  to  the  higher  level  distal  cause  .  Which  is  ?  You  think  with  your  penis  .  That\\'s  a  biological  impossibility  and  you  didn\\'t  have  to  come  .  Oh  ,  right  ,  yes  ,  I  could  have  stayed  behind  and  watched  Wolowitz  try  to  hit  on  Penny  in  Russian  ,  Arabic  and  Farsi  .  Why  can\\'t  she  get  her  own  TV  .  Come  on  ,  you  know  how  it  is  with  break-ups  .  No  ,  I  don\\'t  .  And  neither  do  you  .  Wuh  ,  I  ,  I  broke  up  with  Joyce  Kim  .  You  did  not  break  up  with  Joyce  Kim  ,  she  defected  to  North  Korea  .  To  mend  her  broken  heart  .  This  situation  is  much  less  complicated  .  There\\'s  some  kind  of  dispute  between  Penny  and  her  ex-boyfriend  as  to  who  gets  custody  of  the  TV  .  She  just  wanted  to  avoid  having  a  scene  with  him  .  So  we  get  to  have  a  scene  with  him  ?  No  ,  Sheldon  ,  there\\'s  not  going  to  be  a  scene  .  There\\'s  two  of  us  and  one  of  him  .  Leonard  ,  the  two  of  us  can\\'t  even  carry  a  TV  .  So  ,  you  guys  work  with  Leonard  and  Sheldon  at  the  University  ?  Uh  ,  I\\'m  sorry  ,  do  you  speak  English  ?  Oh  ,  he  speaks  English  ,  he  just  can\\'t  speak  to  women  .  Really  ,  why  ?  He\\'s  kind  of  a  nerd  .  Juice  box  ?  I\\'ll  do  the  talking  .  Yeah  .  Hi  ,  I\\'m  Leonard  ,  this  is  Sheldon  .  Hello  .  What  did  I  just  ...  .  Uh  ,  we\\'re  here  to  pick  up  Penny\\'s  TV  .  Get  lost  .  Okay  ,  thanks  for  your  time  .  We\\'re  not  going  to  give  up  just  like  that  .  Leonard  ,  the  TV  is  in  the  building  ,  we\\'ve  been  denied  access  to  the  building  ,  ergo  we  are  done  .  Excuse  me  ,  if  I  were  to  give  up  at  the  first  little  hitch  I  never  would  have  been  able  to  identify  the  fingerprints  of  string  theory  in  the  aftermath  of  the  big  bang  .  My  apologies  .  What\\'s  your  plan  .  It\\'s  just  a  privilege  to  watch  your  mind  at  work  .  Come  on  ,  we  have  a  combined  IQ  of  3  ,  we  should  be  able  to  figure  out  how  to  get  into  a  stupid  building  .  What  do  you  think  their  combined  IQ  is  ?  Just  grab  the  door  .  This  is  it  .  I\\'ll  do  the  talking  .  Good  thinking  ,  I\\'ll  just  be  the  muscle  .  Yeah  ?  I\\'m  Leonard  ,  this  is  Sheldon  .  From  the  intercom  .  How  the  hell  did  you  get  in  the  building  ?  Oh  .  We\\'re  scientists  .  Tell  him  about  our  IQ  .  Leonard  .  What  ?  My  mom  bought  me  those  pants  .  I\\'m  sorry  .  You\\'re  going  to  have  to  call  her  .  Sheldon  ,  I\\'m  so  sorry  I  dragged  you  through  this  .  It\\'s  okay  .  It  wasn\\'t  my  first  pantsing  ,  and  it  won\\'t  be  my  last  .  And  you  were  right  about  my  motives  ,  I  was  hoping  to  establish  a  relationship  with  Penny  that  might  have  some  day  led  to  sex  .  Well  you  got  me  out  of  my  pants  .  Anyway  ,  I\\'ve  learned  my  lesson  .  She\\'s  out  of  my  league  ,  I\\'m  done  with  her  ,  I\\'ve  got  my  work  ,  one  day  I\\'ll  win  the  Nobel  Prize  and  then  I\\'ll  die  alone  .  Don\\'t  think  like  that  ,  you\\'re  not  going  to  die  alone  .  Thank  you  Sheldon  ,  you\\'re  a  good  friend  .  And  you\\'re  certainly  not  going  to  win  a  Nobel  Prize  .  This  is  one  of  my  favorite  places  to  kick  back  after  a  quest  ,  they  have  a  great  house  ale  .  Wow  ,  cool  tiger  .  Yeah  ,  I\\'ve  had  him  since  level  ten  .  His  name  is  Buttons  .  Anyway  ,  if  you  had  your  own  game  character  we  could  hang  out  ,  maybe  go  on  a  quest  .  Uh  ,  sounds  interesting  .  So  you\\'ll  think  about  it  ?  Oh  ,  I  don\\'t  think  I\\'ll  be  able  to  stop  thinking  about  it  .  Smooth  .  We\\'re  home  .  Oh  ,  my  God  ,  what  happened  ?  Well  ,  your  ex-boyfriend  sends  his  regards  and  I  think  the  rest  is  fairly  self-explanatory  .  I\\'m  so  sorry  ,  I  really  thought  if  you  guys  went  instead  of  me  he  wouldn\\'t  be  such  an  ass  .  No  ,  it  was  a  valid  hypothesis  .  That  was  a  valid  hypothesis  ?  What  is  happening  to  you  ?  Really  ,  thank  you  so  much  for  going  and  trying  you\\'re  ,  uh  ,  you\\'re  so  terrific  .  Why  don\\'t  you  put  some  clothes  on  ,  I\\'ll  get  my  purse  and  dinner  is  on  me  ,  okay  ?  Really  ?  Great  .  Thank  you  .  You\\'re  not  done  with  her  ,  are  you  ?

So  ?  They\\'re  both  curry  based  cuisines  .  So  ?  They  would  be  gastronomically  redundant  .  I  can  see  we\\'re  going  to  have  to  spell  out  everything  for  this  girl  .  Any  ideas  Raj  ?  Turn  left  on  Lake  Street  and  head  up  to  Colorado  .  I  know  a  wonderful  little  sushi  bar  that  has  karaoke  .  That  sounds  like  fun  .  Baby  ,  baby  don\\'t  get  hooked  on  me  .  Uh  ,  baby  ,  baby  don\\'t  get  hooked  on  me  .  I  don\\'t  know  what  your  odds  are  in  the  world  as  a  whole  ,  but  as  far  as  the  population  of  this  car  goes  ,  you\\'re  a  veritable  Mack  Daddy  .'"

Thank  you  ,  maybe  we  can  have  coffee  sometime  .  Oh  ,  great  .  Great  .  Great  .  Great  .  Well  ,  bye  .  Bye  .  Bye  .  Bye  .  Should  we  have  invited  her  for  lunch  ?  No  .  We\\'re  going  to  start  Season  Two  of  \"  Battlestar  Galactica  \"  .  We  already  watched  the  Season  Two  DVDs  .  Not  with  commentary  .  I  think  we  should  be  good  neighbors  ,  invite  her  over  ,  make  her  feel  welcome  .  We  never  invited  Louis-slash-Louise  over  .  Well  ,  then  that  was  wrong  of  us  .  We  need  to  widen  our  circle  .  I  have  a  very  wide  circle  .  I  have  212  friends  on  myspace  .  Yes  ,  and  you\\'ve  never  met  one  of  them  .  That\\'s  the  beauty  of  it  .  I\\'m  going  to  invite  her  over  .  We\\'ll  have  a  nice  meal  and  chat  .  Chat  ?  We  don\\'t  chat  .  At  least  not  offline  .  Well  it\\'s  not  difficult  ,  you  just  listen  to  what  she  says  ,  and  then  you  say  something  appropriate  in  response  .  To  what  end  ?  Hi  .  Again  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Hi  .  Anyway  ,  um  .  We  brought  home  Indian  food  .  And  ,  um  .  I  know  that  moving  can  be  stressful  ,  and  I  find  that  when  I\\'m  undergoing  stress  ,  that  good  food  and  company  can  have  a  comforting  effect  .  Also  ,  curry  is  a  natural  laxative  ,  and  I  don\\'t  have  to  tell  you  that  ,  uh  ,  a  clean  colon  is  just  one  less  thing  to  worry  about  .  Leonard  ,  I\\'m  not  expert  here  but  I  believe  in  the  context  of  a  luncheon  invitation  ,  you  might  want  to  skip  the  reference  to  bowel  movements  .  Oh  ,  you\\'re  inviting  me  over  to  eat  ?  Uh  ,  yes  .  Oh  ,  that\\'s  so  nice  ,  I\\'d  love  to  .  Great  .  So  ,  what  do  you  guys  do  for  fun  around  here  ?  Well  ,  today  we  tried  masturbating  for  money  .  Okay  ,  well  ,  make  yourself  at  home  .  Okay  ,  thankyou  .  You\\'re  very  welcome  .  This  looks  like  some  serious  stuff  ,  Leonard  ,  did  you  do  this  ?  Actually  that\\'s  my  work  .  Wow  .  Yeah  ,  well  ,  it\\'s  just  some  quantum  mechanics  ,  with  a  little  string  theory  doodling  around  the  edges  .  That  part  there  ,  that\\'s  just  a  joke  ,  it\\'s  a  spoof  of  the  Bourne-Oppenheimer  approximation  .  So  you\\'re  like  ,  one  of  those  ,  beautiful  mind  genius  guys  .  Yeah  .  This  is  really  impressive  .  I  have  a  board  .  If  you  like  boards  ,  this  is  my  board  .  Holy  smokes  .  If  by  holy  smokes  you  mean  a  derivative  restatement  of  the  kind  of  stuff  you  can  find  scribbled  on  the  wall  of  any  men\\'s  room  at  MIT  ,  sure  .  What  ?  Oh  ,  come  on  .  Who  hasn\\'t  seen  this  differential  below  \"  here  I  sit  broken  hearted?  \"  At  least  I  didn\\'t  have  to  invent  twenty-six  dimensions  just  to  make  the  math  come  out  .  I  didn\\'t  invent  them  ,  they\\'re  there  .  In  what  universe  ?  In  all  of  them  ,  that  is  the  point  .  Uh  ,  do  you  guys  mind  if  I  start  ?  Um  ,  Penny  ...  that\\'s  where  I  sit  .  So  ,  sit  next  to  me  .  ...  No  ,  I  sit  there  .  What\\'s  the  difference  ?  \"  What\\'s  the  difference  \"  ?  Here  we  go  .  In  the  winter  that  seat  is  close  enough  to  the  radiator  to  remain  warm  ,  and  yet  not  so  close  as  to  cause  perspiration  .  In  the  summer  it\\'s  directly  in  the  path  of  a  cross  breeze  created  by  open  windows  there  ,  and  there  .  It  faces  the  television  at  an  angle  that  is  neither  direct  ,  thus  discouraging  conversation  ,  nor  so  far  wide  to  create  a  parallax  distortion  .  I  could  go  on  ,  but  I  think  I\\'ve  made  my  point  .  Do  you  want  me  to  move  ?  Well-  Just  sit  somewhere  else  .  Fine  .  Sheldon  ,  sit  !  Aaah  !  Well  ,  this  is  nice  .  We  don\\'t  have  a  lot  of  company  over  .  That\\'s  not  true  .  Koothrapali  and  Wolowitz  come  over  all  the  time  .  Yes  ,  I  know  ,  but  ...  Tuesday  night  we  played  Klingon  boggle  until  one  in  the  morning  .  Yes  ,  I  remember  .  I  resent  you  saying  we  don\\'t  have  company  .  I\\'m  sorry  .  That  is  an  antisocial  implication  .  I  said  I\\'m  sorry  .  So  ,  Klingon  boggle  ?  Yeah  ,  it\\'s  like  regular  boggle  ,  but  in  Klingon  .  That\\'s  probably  enough  about  us  ,  tell  us  about  you  .  Um  ,  me  ,  okay  ,  I\\'m  Sagittarius  ,  which  probably  tells  you  way  more  than  you  need  to  know  .  Yes  ,  it  tells  us  that  you  participate  in  the  mass  cultural  delusion  that  the  Sun\\'s  apparent  position  relative  to  arbitrarily  defined  constellations  and  the  time  of  your  birth  somehow  effects  your  personality  .  Participate  in  the  what  ?  I  think  what  Sheldon\\'s  trying  to  say  ,  is  that  Sagittarius  wouldn\\'t  have  been  our  first  guess  .  Oh  ,  yeah  ,  a  lot  of  people  think  I\\'m  a  water  sign  .  Okay  ,  let\\'s  see  ,  what  else  ,  oh  ,  I\\'m  a  vegetarian  ,  oh  ,  except  for  fish  ,  and  the  occasional  steak  ,  I  love  steak  .  That\\'s  interesting  .  Leonard  can\\'t  process  corn  .  Wu-uh  ,  do  you  have  some  sort  of  a  job  ?  Oh  ,  yeah  ,  I\\'m  a  waitress  at  the  Cheesecake  Factory  .  Oh  ,  okay  .  I  love  cheesecake  .  You\\'re  lactose  intolerant  .  I  don\\'t  eat  it  ,  I  just  think  it\\'s  a  good  idea  .  Oh  ,  anyways  ,  I\\'m  also  writing  a  screenplay  .  It\\'s  about  this  sensitive  girl  who  comes  to  L.A  .  from  Lincoln  Nebraska  to  be  an  actress  ,  and  winds  up  a  waitress  at  the  Cheesecake  Factory  .  So  it\\'s  based  on  your  life  ?  No  ,  I\\'m  from  Omaha  .  Well  ,  if  that  was  a  movie  I  would  go  see  it  .  I  know  ,  right  ?  Okay  ,  let\\'s  see  ,  what  else  ?  Um  ,  that\\'s  about  it  .  That\\'s  the  story  of  Penny  .  Well  it  sounds  wonderful  .  It  was  .  Until  I  fell  in  love  with  a  jerk  .  What\\'s  happening  .  I  don\\'t  know  .  Oh  God  ,  you  know  ,  four  years  I  lived  with  him  ,  four  years  ,  that\\'s  like  as  long  as  High  School  .  It  took  you  four  years  to  get  through  High  School  ?  Don\\'t  .  I  just  ,  I  can\\'t  believe  I  trusted  him  .  Should  I  say  something  ?  I  feel  like  I  should  say  something  .  You  ?  No  ,  you\\'ll  only  make  it  worse  .  You  want  to  know  the  most  pathetic  part  ?  Even  though  I  hate  his  lying  ,  cheating  guts  ,  I  still  love  him  .  Is  that  crazy  ?  Yes  .  No  ,  it\\'s  not  crazy  it\\'s  ,  uh  ,  uh  ,  it\\'s  a  paradox  .  And  paradoxes  are  part  of  nature  ,  think  about  light  .  Now  if  you  look  at  Huygens  ,  light  is  a  wave  ,  as  confirmed  by  the  double  slit  experiments  ,  but  then  ,  along  comes  Albert  Einstein  and  discovers  that  light  behaves  like  particles  too  .  Well  ,  I  didn\\'t  make  it  worse  .  Oh  ,  I\\'m  so  sorry  ,  I\\'m  such  a  mess  ,  and  on  top  of  everything  else  I\\'m  all  gross  from  moving  and  my  stupid  shower  doesn\\'t  even  work  .  Our  shower  works  .  Really  ?  Would  it  be  totally  weird  if  I  used  it  ?  Yes  .  No  .  No  ?  No  .  No  .  It\\'s  right  down  the  hall  .  Thanks  .  You  guys  are  really  sweet  .  Well  this  is  an  interesting  development  .  How  so  ?  It  has  been  some  time  since  we\\'ve  had  a  woman  take  her  clothes  off  in  our  apartment  .  That\\'s  not  true  ,  remember  at  Thanksgiving  my  grandmother  with  Alzheimer\\'s  had  that  episode  .  Point  taken  .  It  has  been  some  time  since  we\\'ve  had  a  woman  take  her  clothes  off  after  which  we  didn\\'t  want  to  rip  our  eyes  out  .  The  worst  part  was  watching  her  carve  that  turkey  .  So  ,  what  exactly  are  you  trying  to  accomplish  here  ?  Excuse  me  ?  That  woman  in  there\\'s  not  going  to  have  sex  with  you  .  Well  I\\'m  not  trying  to  have  sex  with  her  .  Oh  ,  good  .  Then  you  won\\'t  be  disappointed  .  What  makes  you  think  she  wouldn\\'t  have  sex  with  me  ,  I\\'m  a  male  and  she\\'s  a  female  ?  Yes  ,  but  not  of  the  same  species  .  I\\'m  not  going  to  engage  in  hypotheticals  here  ,  I\\'m  just  trying  to  be  a  good  neighbor  .  Oh  ,  of  course  .  That\\'s  not  to  say  that  if  a  carnal  relationship  were  to  develop  that  I  wouldn\\'t  participate  .  However  briefly  .  Do  you  think  this  possibility  will  be  helped  or  hindered  when  she  discovers  your  Luke  Skywalker  no-more-tears  shampoo  ?  It\\'s  Darth  Vader  shampoo  .  Luke  Skywalker\\'s  the  conditioner  .  Wait  till  you  see  this  .  It\\'s  fantastic  .  Unbelievable  .  See  what  ?  It\\'s  a  Stephen  Hawking  lecture  from  MIT  in  1974  .  This  is  not  a  good  time  .  It\\'s  before  he  became  a  creepy  computer  voice  That\\'s  great  ,  you  guys  have  to  go  .  Why  ?  It\\'s  just  not  a  good  time  .  Leonard  has  a  lady  over  .  Yeah  ,  right  ,  your  grandmother  back  in  town  ?  No  .  And  she\\'s  not  a  lady  ,  she\\'s  just  a  new  neighbor  .  Hang  on  ,  there  really  is  a  lady  here  ?  Uh-huh  .  And  you  want  us  out  because  you\\'re  anticipating  coitus  ?  I\\'m  not  anticipating  coitus  .  So  she\\'s  available  for  coitus  ?  Can  we  please  stop  saying  coitus  ?  Technically  that  would  be  coitus  interruptus  .  Hey  ,  is  there  a  trick  to  getting  it  to  switch  from  tub  to  shower  ?  Oh  .  Hi  ,  sorry  .  Hello  !  Enchante  ,  Madamoiselle  .  Howard  Wolowitz  ,  Cal-Tech  department  of  Applied  Physics  .  You  may  be  familiar  with  some  of  my  work  ,  it\\'s  currently  orbiting  Jupiter\\'s  largest  moon  taking  high-resolution  digital  photographs  .  Penny  .  I  work  at  the  Cheesecake  Factory  .  Come  on  ,  I\\'ll  show  you  the  trick  with  the  shower  .  Bon  douche  .  I\\'m  sorry  ?  It\\'s  French  for  good  shower  .  It\\'s  a  sentiment  I  can  express  in  six  languages  .  Save  it  for  your  blog  ,  Howard  .  See-ka-tong-guay-jow  .  Uh  ,  there  it  goes  ,  it  sticks  ,  I\\'m  sorry  .  Okay  .  Thanks  .  You\\'re  welcome  ,  oh  ,  you\\'re  going  to  step  right  ,  okay  ,  I\\'ll  ...  .  Hey  ,  Leonard  ?  The  hair  products  are  Sheldon\\'s  .  Um  ,  okay  .  Can  I  ask  you  a  favour  .  A  favour  ?  Sure  ,  you  can  ask  me  a  favour  ,  I  would  do  you  a  favour  for  you  .  It\\'s  okay  if  you  say  no  .  Oh  ,  I\\'ll  probably  say  yes  .  It\\'s  just  not  the  kind  of  thing  you  ask  a  guy  you\\'ve  just  met  .  Wow  .  I  really  think  we  should  examine  the  chain  of  causality  here  .  Must  we  ?  Event  A.  A  beautiful  woman  stands  naked  in  our  shower  .  Event  B.  We  drive  half  way  across  town  to  retrieve  a  television  set  from  the  aforementioned  woman\\'s  ex-boyfriend  .  Query  ,  on  what  plane  of  existence  is  there  even  a  semi-rational  link  between  these  events  ?  She  asked  me  to  do  her  a  favour  ,  Sheldon  .  Ah  ,  yes  ,  well  that  may  be  the  proximal  cause  of  our  journey  ,  but  we  both  know  it  only  exists  in  contradistinction  to  the  higher  level  distal  cause  .  Which  is  ?  You  think  with  your  penis  .  That\\'s  a  biological  impossibility  and  you  didn\\'t  have  to  come  .  Oh  ,  right  ,  yes  ,  I  could  have  stayed  behind  and  watched  Wolowitz  try  to  hit  on  Penny  in  Russian  ,  Arabic  and  Farsi  .  Why  can\\'t  she  get  her  own  TV  .  Come  on  ,  you  know  how  it  is  with  break-ups  .  No  ,  I  don\\'t  .  And  neither  do  you  .  Wuh  ,  I  ,  I  broke  up  with  Joyce  Kim  .  You  did  not  break  up  with  Joyce  Kim  ,  she  defected  to  North  Korea  .  To  mend  her  broken  heart  .  This  situation  is  much  less  complicated  .  There\\'s  some  kind  of  dispute  between  Penny  and  her  ex-boyfriend  as  to  who  gets  custody  of  the  TV  .  She  just  wanted  to  avoid  having  a  scene  with  him  .  So  we  get  to  have  a  scene  with  him  ?  No  ,  Sheldon  ,  there\\'s  not  going  to  be  a  scene  .  There\\'s  two  of  us  and  one  of  him  .  Leonard  ,  the  two  of  us  can\\'t  even  carry  a  TV  .  So  ,  you  guys  work  with  Leonard  and  Sheldon  at  the  University  ?  Uh  ,  I\\'m  sorry  ,  do  you  speak  English  ?  Oh  ,  he  speaks  English  ,  he  just  can\\'t  speak  to  women  .  Really  ,  why  ?  He\\'s  kind  of  a  nerd  .  Juice  box  ?  I\\'ll  do  the  talking  .  Yeah  .  Hi  ,  I\\'m  Leonard  ,  this  is  Sheldon  .  Hello  .  What  did  I  just  ...  .  Uh  ,  we\\'re  here  to  pick  up  Penny\\'s  TV  .  Get  lost  .  Okay  ,  thanks  for  your  time  .  We\\'re  not  going  to  give  up  just  like  that  .  Leonard  ,  the  TV  is  in  the  building  ,  we\\'ve  been  denied  access  to  the  building  ,  ergo  we  are  done  .  Excuse  me  ,  if  I  were  to  give  up  at  the  first  little  hitch  I  never  would  have  been  able  to  identify  the  fingerprints  of  string  theory  in  the  aftermath  of  the  big  bang  .  My  apologies  .  What\\'s  your  plan  .  It\\'s  just  a  privilege  to  watch  your  mind  at  work  .  Come  on  ,  we  have  a  combined  IQ  of  3  ,  we  should  be  able  to  figure  out  how  to  get  into  a  stupid  building  .  What  do  you  think  their  combined  IQ  is  ?  Just  grab  the  door  .  This  is  it  .  I\\'ll  do  the  talking  .  Good  thinking  ,  I\\'ll  just  be  the  muscle  .  Yeah  ?  I\\'m  Leonard  ,  this  is  Sheldon  .  From  the  intercom  .  How  the  hell  did  you  get  in  the  building  ?  Oh  .  We\\'re  scientists  .  Tell  him  about  our  IQ  .  Leonard  .  What  ?  My  mom  bought  me  those  pants  .  I\\'m  sorry  .  You\\'re  going  to  have  to  call  her  .  Sheldon  ,  I\\'m  so  sorry  I  dragged  you  through  this  .  It\\'s  okay  .  It  wasn\\'t  my  first  pantsing  ,  and  it  won\\'t  be  my  last  .  And  you  were  right  about  my  motives  ,  I  was  hoping  to  establish  a  relationship  with  Penny  that  might  have  some  day  led  to  sex  .  Well  you  got  me  out  of  my  pants  .  Anyway  ,  I\\'ve  learned  my  lesson  .  She\\'s  out  of  my  league  ,  I\\'m  done  with  her  ,  I\\'ve  got  my  work  ,  one  day  I\\'ll  win  the  Nobel  Prize  and  then  I\\'ll  die  alone  .  Don\\'t  think  like  that  ,  you\\'re  not  going  to  die  alone  .  Thank  you  Sheldon  ,  you\\'re  a  good  friend  .  And  you\\'re  certainly  not  going  to  win  a  Nobel  Prize  .  This  is  one  of  my  favorite  places  to  kick  back  after  a  quest  ,  they  have  a  great  house  ale  .  Wow  ,  cool  tiger  .  Yeah  ,  I\\'ve  had  him  since  level  ten  .  His  name  is  Buttons  .  Anyway  ,  if  you  had  your  own  game  character  we  could  hang  out  ,  maybe  go  on  a  quest  .  Uh  ,  sounds  interesting  .  So  you\\'ll  think  about  it  ?  Oh  ,  I  don\\'t  think  I\\'ll  be  able  to  stop  thinking  about  it  .  Smooth  .  We\\'re  home  .  Oh  ,  my  God  ,  what  happened  ?  Well  ,  your  ex-boyfriend  sends  his  regards  and  I  think  the  rest  is  fairly  self-explanatory  .  I\\'m  so  sorry  ,  I  really  thought  if  you  guys  went  instead  of  me  he  wouldn\\'t  be  such  an  ass  .  No  ,  it  was  a  valid  hypothesis  .  That  was  a  valid  hypothesis  ?  What  is  happening  to  you  ?  Really  ,  thank  you  so  much  for  going  and  trying  you\\'re  ,  uh  ,  you\\'re  so  terrific  .  Why  don\\'t  you  put  some  clothes  on  ,  I\\'ll  get  my  purse  and  dinner  is  on  me  ,  okay  ?  Really  ?  Great  .  Thank  you  .  You\\'re  not  done  with  her  ,  are  you  ?  Our  babies  will  be  smart  and  beautiful  .  Not  to  mention  imaginary  .  Is  Thai  food  okay  with  you  Penny  ?  Sure  .  We  can\\'t  have  Thai  food  ,  we  had  Indian  for  lunch  .  So  ?  They\\'re  both  curry  based  cuisines  .  So  ?  They  would  be  gastronomically  redundant  .  I  can  see  we\\'re  going  to  have  to  spell  out  everything  for  this  girl  .  Any  ideas  Raj  ?  Turn  left  on  Lake  Street  and  head  up  to  Colorado  .  I  know  a  wonderful  little  sushi  bar  that  has  karaoke  .  That  sounds  like  fun  .  Baby  ,  baby  don\\'t  get  hooked  on  me  .  Uh  ,  baby  ,  baby  don\\'t  get  hooked  on  me  .  I  don\\'t  know  what  your  odds  are  in  the  world  as  a  whole  ,  but  as  far  as  the  population  of  this  car  goes  ,  you\\'re  a  veritable  Mack  Daddy  .'"
